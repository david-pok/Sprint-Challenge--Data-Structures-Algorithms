Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
O(n)
because it passes over the tree once

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
somewhere in between O(n^2) and O(n)
using an array as a queue is not good because everytime 1 element is shifted, everything else gets shifted, also other reasons

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
